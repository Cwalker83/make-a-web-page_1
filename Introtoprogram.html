<div class="How the web works">
<p>html= hypertext markup language (main type of document on the web is html)<br>
major pieces of web<br>
you / cpu running browser / the internet / servers<br>
<ol>
<li>A. Browser- a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li><br>
<li>B. Internet- the worlds largest computer network</li><br>
<li>C. HTTP- the main protocol of the web</li><br>
<li>D. Servers- computers that host the files that make up the web</li><br>

HTML or hypertext markup language html is made up of text content (what you see) markup (what it looks like)
references to other documents example images and videos links to webpage </p>
</div>

<div class="Tags">
<p>HTML  <tag> blah blah </closingtag>
all of this is referred to as an element
<b>blahblah</b> this would display blahblah in bold
<em>blahblah</em> this would display blahblah in italics
creating link (anchor)     <a href="www.w3c.org/html"></a>
<img> - images
<img src="url" alt="text">
<br> is a block element  <p></p> is a inline element
<br> is a line break this moves stuff to the next line (ends a sentence) put at end of word and or sentence or you can put it below the sentence.
<p> is for paragraph and is kind of the same as <br> but it creates an invisible box around the first line with height and width
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We're using two lines now!</p>
<span></span> is inline 
<div></div> is block
elements that are inline are  a / span / br / img / strong </p>
</div>

  <p> It is good to avoid repetition when programming as this creates more unnecessary work.</p>

<div class="Structure">
  <p>
  html , java script , css are the 3 languages that go into web development.
html is the structure house (controls the structure of a web page)
css is the style of your house (controls the style of a page or how it looks)
When programmers talk about the "DOM" (document object model) they are talking about the tree like structure of a page.
java script is the interactive parts of the house like the garage door or remote
Structuring has a tree like structure
Structure starts with HTML then head then body and branchs out from there.
